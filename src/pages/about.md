The [Homepage](/) uses the `archive.njk` layout which displays your blog post in reverse chronological order (from newest to oldest). Open `/pages/index.md` to view the front matter setup of this page.

The [Archive page](/archive/) also uses the `archive.njk` layout. Notice how I added a page title, intro paragraph, post dates and post excerpts just by editing front matter. Open `/pages/archive.md` to view the front matter setup of this page.

The [Blog page](/blog/) uses the `blog.njk` layout to paginate your posts to just show your latest articles. Open `/pages/blog.md` to view the front matter setup of this page.
